# 4DSTEM-Calibration
Calibration of 4D STEM dataset

The infocus calibration folder contains the jupyter notebooks related to geometrical calibration of 4D-STEM dataset imaged with a focused electron probe.
The defocus calibration folder contains the jupyter notebooks related to geometrical calibration of 4D-STEM dataset imaged with an out-of-focus electron probe.

The out-of-focus calibration code will be available when the corresponding paper is accepted, please wait for a while.
